# 1.) Rolling The Bullet
Probability After Rolling  = 2/6 as both remains
Now probability of next given the current is not is 1/4 as only one case where the next one is . So increase the probability 
# 2.) Pirates & The Treasure
If 2 person remains the level 1 gets nothing ... So if level 3 give incentive for level1 even of the smallest he will be ready so level2 will not get same goes for 3 pirate level 4 will get incentive from 2nd pirate so he will decide .. and so on so distribution will be (98,0,1,0,1)
# 3.) The Returning Explorer
He is at the poles so white
Futhur any where (1+ 1/2πn) works as circling the earth will work. Also he can be at the exact pole
# 4.) Which Switch?
Class Solution left one on and then switch off and other on before checking
For 4 bulbs
        On	Off
Hot	    1	2
Cold	3	4
# 5.) Lucky Candy
Place 1 good candy in one box and all the remaining (49 good and 50 rotten candies) in the second box.

As we need argmax x/T + 50-x/100-T which has 2 variables x and T
# 6.) All Girls World?
Suppose there are N couples who want a all girl world they will have 
E[1/2 + 2 * (1/2)^2 ...] child which gives 1:1 ratio thus Now N/2 couples with the same ratio tries so always 1:1
# 7.) Tigers & The Sheep
Yeah no one will make the first move 
# 8.) Duck & Fox
Move a little ahead and create a phase lag with the fox to reduce the require covering distance gives maxm fox speed pi + 1 btw 
# 9.) The Plane in the Wind
time 2x / x^2 - v^2 so simply it will be more than 2/x
# 10.) Burning Cords
Classic double side burn 
# 11.) Pair of Socks
3 2 of both kind will be the maxm thing you can get
# 12.) Antipodal points
Difference is x let between two opposite points it negates at the other half so must pass through 0
# 13.) Half Time
t + (1-t) * t = 3/4 therefore t = 1/2
# 14.) Monty Hall Problem
Classic Monty Hall you should it doubles the chances btw
# 15.) Prisoner's Hat
We can number prisoners from 100 to 1, with 100 being the last person in the line. Prisoners agree that if the 100th person will say "red" if there are an even number of "red" hats visible on the prisoners 1 to 99, and blue otherwise. This way, prisoner number 99 can look ahead and count the red hats. 
# 16.) Knight and Knave
Ask if one door is correct will be said by other
# 17.) Water & Wine
The final volumes of both the mixture-liquids are equal. This means in the first jars, the combined volume of water & wine is the same as that of jar B
# 18.) 100 Light bulbs
Square nos
# 19.) UnBiased coin
For an arbitrary p, this cannot be accomplished in a single toss. If we toss twice, we observe that the probability of HT and TH is the same, i.e. the probability of heads in the first toss and tails in the second is the same as its reverse,
# 20.) You have a train to catch!
The gap from M to G is 1 minute
# 21.) 2 Eggs
n*(n+1)/2
# 22.) Shooting in Circle
Every time the even dies so 1 thrives 
# 23.) Invisible Dice
Too sum 3 1's we need 3 zeroes and 3 sixes to get 12
so it is basically even chances of getting [1 to 6] then [7 to 12]
# 24.) Daughter or Son
1/2 1/3 1/2 Simple conditional probability
# 25.) Dark Room Deck
Create a deck of 10 cards randomly from the original 52-card deck. And then turn over the 10-card deck.
# 26.) Cheating Husbands
10 ... blue eyed problem type thing
# 27.) Father of lies
Bayes theorem 
# 28.) Devil's Penny
You place a penny right in the center of the table. After that, whenever the devil places a penny on the table, mimic his placement by placing a penny diametrically opposite and at same distance from center. If he has a place to place a penny, so will you. The devil will run out of places to put a quarter before you do.
# 29.) Witches at the coffee shop
Plot the graph and find area
# 30.) Poisonous wine
Every Prisoner can give three states die in 3 weeks die in 4 weeks or don't die. And he got 10 prisoners. We also have 10 prisoners to distinguish so 30 bits We don't even need 4 weeks thing .
# 31.) Half Heads
X * X'
