## 1.) Drunk Passenger
Note that the last passenger can only take seat #1 or #100.

If any passenger takes seat #1, the cycle stops, and all the subsequent passengers take their own seats (including the last).
Otherwise, if the #100 seat is taken before #1, the cycle is paused, i.e., the subsequent passengers do take their own seats, but the last passenger would take seat #1.
Now, any passenger from 1st to 99th who is picking a random vacant seat will choose between #1, #100 or any other seat equally likely. Thus, by symmetry, #1 or #100, anyone will be taken first - with equal probability.

Hence the last person ends up in their own seat with a probability of 0.5
## 11.) Counting on friends
Total possible number of friends = 0,1,....N-1
Now if there someone has N-1 friends then the rest N-1 people can't have 0 friends thus py PHP and similarly for if someone has 0.
## 12.) Random Ratio
Plot graph and calculate area.
## 13.) Second Chance
Only roll if 1 or 2 or 3 (3.5+5)/2
## 14.) Innocent Monkey
E(x) = 5/6 * 3 + 1/6 * (5 + E(x))
## 15.) Consecutive Heads
E(n) = 1/2 * (E(n-1)+1) + 1/2(E(n-1)+1+E(n))
## 16.) Chess Tournament
in diff cohorts then done (n-1)Cn/2-1/(n-1)Cn/2-1
## 17.) Number of Double Heads
 E(n) = 1/2 * E(n-1) + 1/2 * ( 1/2 * (E(n-1)+1) + 1/2 * (E(n-1)))
## 18.) Breaking Stick
Graph can help to visualize
## 19.) Prisoner's Hat (multicolor)-
Call the first person in back of row the 100th prisoner. The 10 colours will be given codes from 0 to 9. The 100th prisoner will sum the numbers associated with the 99 colours he sees and will say the colour corresponding to it modulo 10. This is enough for 99th person. All he needs to do now is connect the dots, sum the number of hats he can see, calculate modulo 10, and compare it with what 100th prisoner said. This way all 99 prisoners will be saved, and 100th prisoner dies with probability 9/10.
## 20.) Rainbow Hats
Let the persons be numbered 0 to N-1. The i-th person should announce 1 + (i-s)mod N, where s is the sum of numbers he sees. With this strategy, if the sum of all N numbers equals 1 + (m mod N), then the m-th gnome is guaranteed to announce the number of his own hat!
## 21.) 2 Equations & 3 Unknowns
Use (1,1,1) to get idea of size of nos then give (1,10^d ,10^2d) type things
## 22.) Domino Covering
Classic removing two whites from a chess board
## 23.) Fruit Magic
Every Collision leads to -1,+2,-1 We need 43 and other two equal at some point . We  need two types to be equal at some point. We get 14 15 16 after one B and C collision. For modulo 3 they are different and All have relative modulo 3 same.
## 24.) Catching Ants
Divide into 25 areas so always by PHP.
<!-- ## 25.) Color Complex -->
