**Goal:** Understand psychology as a science of mind and behavior, not as self-help or social media content.

**Time Horizon:** ~9–12 months (can be faster or slower without loss)  
**Style:** Books + reasoning + reflection  
**Output:** Conceptual mastery, epistemic discipline, comfort with uncertainty

## PHASE 0 — Calibration (Optional, 7–10 Days)

### Purpose

Align terminology and scope before deeper theory.

### Material

- **NCERT Psychology – Class 11** (selective)
    

### How to Use

- Skim chapters on:
    
    - What is psychology
        
    - Learning
        
    - Memory
        
    - Human development
        
    - Research methods
        
- Ignore:
    
    - Exam questions
        
    - Case studies
        
    - Clinical framing
        

### Output

- Basic vocabulary
    
- Clear mental map of subfields
    

> Skip this phase entirely if you are comfortable starting abstract.

## PHASE 1 — Epistemic Foundation (4–6 Weeks)

### Goal

Learn **how psychology knows what it claims to know**.

### Core Book

1. **How to Think Straight About Psychology — Keith Stanovich**
    

### What You Are Learning

- Why intuition fails
    
- Scientific vs anecdotal reasoning
    
- Correlation vs causation
    
- Why psychology is often misunderstood
    
- How to evaluate claims
    

### Study Method

- Read slowly
    
- Write short explanations in plain English
    
- Actively challenge examples
    

### Output

- Resistance to pseudo-psychology
    
- Intellectual discipline
    
- Proper skepticism (not cynicism)
    

**This phase is non-negotiable.**

## PHASE 2 — Core Theory: Cognitive Psychology (10–14 Weeks)

### Goal

Understand **how the mind processes information**.

### Core Book

2. **Cognitive Psychology — Eysenck & Keane**
    

### Topics Covered

- Attention
    
- Memory systems
    
- Perception
    
- Language
    
- Reasoning
    
- Decision-making
    

### How to Study (Critical)

For each chapter:

- Identify the _problem_ being solved
    
- Diagram the model
    
- List assumptions
    
- Note what the model cannot explain
    
- Compare competing theories
    

### Output

- Mental models of cognition
    
- Ability to explain behavior without anecdotes
    
- Comfort with competing explanations
    

This is the **spine** of your psychology understanding.

## PHASE 3 — Behavior & Learning (4–6 Weeks)

### Goal

Understand behavior **without invoking the mind**.

### Core Book

3. **Science and Human Behavior — B. F. Skinner**
    

### Why This Matters

- Shows pure environmental explanation
    
- Forces clarity about reinforcement
    
- Sharpens understanding of what cognition must add
    

You are not here to agree—you are here to **understand the logic**.

### Output

- Strong grasp of conditioning
    
- Clear sense of behaviorism’s strengths and limits
    

---

## PHASE 4 — Judgment, Bias, and Uncertainty (6–8 Weeks)

### Goal

Understand **how humans reason under constraints**.

### Core Book

4. **Judgment Under Uncertainty — Kahneman, Slovic, Tversky**
    

### Why This Over Popular Books

- Original experiments
    
- Clean methodology
    
- No narrative distortion
    

### What You Learn

- Heuristics as strategies, not flaws
    
- Systematic biases
    
- Experimental reasoning
    
- Limits of rational models
    

### Output

- Ability to predict reasoning errors
    
- Understanding of bounded rationality
    
- Respect for probabilistic thinking
    

---

## PHASE 5 — Integration Across Levels (6–8 Weeks)

### Goal

See behavior across **time scales and biological layers**.

### Capstone Book

5. **Behave — Robert Sapolsky**
    

### Why This Comes Last

- Integrates:
    
    - Neuroscience
        
    - Development
        
    - Hormones
        
    - Culture
        
    - Evolution
        
- Explicit about uncertainty
    
- Requires prior models to fully appreciate
    

### Output

- Systems-level understanding
    
- Intellectual humility
    
- Comfort with complexity

## HOW TO STUDY (Global Rules)

- Read **1 book at a time**
    
- 30–60 minutes/day
    
- Write explanations, not highlights
    
- Never memorize
    
- Always ask:
    
    - What problem is being solved?
        
    - What assumptions are made?
        
    - What would falsify this?
        

---

## WHAT TO AVOID (Until Much Later)

- Personality typing (MBTI, Enneagram)
    
- “Dark psychology”
    
- Body language decoding
    
- Therapy advice
    
- Social media psychology
    

These become **easy to dismantle later**.

---

## END STATE (What You’ll Have)

By the end of this roadmap, you will:

- Understand psychology as a **scientific modeling effort**
    
- Think in **mechanisms, not labels**
    
- Be immune to pop psychology
    
- Ask better questions than most practitioners
    
- Be ready to specialize (or stop, content)
    

This is **real understanding**, not content accumulation.
